## 🌟 Why KamalLang?

- To inspire **newbies, kids, Tamil cinema fans, and Python beginners**
- To creatively connect **pop culture with programming**
- As a tribute to Kamal Haasan's visionary work, intellect, and his mention of **Replit** during the *"Thug Life"* promo — which sparked this very journey.
