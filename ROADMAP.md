# KamalLang Roadmap 🚀

## v1.1 - The "Thug Life" Update (Q4 2024)
### New Features
- **WHILE loops** (as `WHILE [condition] ACT` inspired by *Anbe Sivam*)  
  ```kamal
  INTELLECT counter = 0
  WHILE counter < 5 ACT
      KAMAL.SPEAK "Scene " + str(counter)
      counter = counter + 1
  ```

- **Functions as "CHARACTERS"**  
  ```kamal
  CHARACTER Chachi420()
      KAMAL.SPEAK "Comedy mode activated!"
  END
  ```

- **Tamil Keywords** (Optional)  
  ```kamal
  பேச "வணக்கம்!"  # Equivalent to KAMAL.SPEAK
  ```

### Improvements
- Better error messages with Kamal movie references
- Support lists as `FILMOGRAPHY = [ "Nayagan", "Indian" ]`

---

## Future Ideas
- **Replit Template** for easy sharing
- **VS Code Extension** with syntax highlighting
- **Kamal-themed ASCII art** on program start
